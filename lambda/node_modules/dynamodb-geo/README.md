#Geo Library for Amazon DynamoDB
This project is an unofficial port of [awslabs/dynamodb-geo][dynamodb-geo], bringing creation and querying of geospatial data to Node JS developers using [Amazon DynamoDB][dynamodb].

##Features
* **Box Queries:** Return all of the items that fall within a pair of geo points that define a rectangle as projected onto a sphere.
* **Radius Queries:** Return all of the items that are within a given radius of a geo point.
* **Basic CRUD Operations:** Create, retrieve, update, and delete geospatial data items.
* **Customizable:** Access to raw request and result objects from the AWS SDK for javascript.
* **Fully Typed:** This port is written in typescript and declaration files are bundled into releases.

##Limitations

###No composite key support
Currently, the library does not support composite keys. You may want to add tags such as restaurant, bar, and coffee shop, and search locations of a specific category; however, it is currently not possible. You need to create a table for each tag and store the items separately.

###Queries retrieve all paginated data
Although low level [DynamoDB Query][dynamodb-query] requests return paginated results, this library automatically pages through the entire result set. When querying a large area with many points, a lot of Read Capacity Units may be consumed.

###More Read Capacity Units
The library retrieves candidate Geo points from the cells that intersect the requested bounds. The library then post-processes the candidate data, filtering out the specific points that are outside the requested bounds. Therefore, the consumed Read Capacity Units will be higher than the final results dataset.

###High memory consumption
Because all paginated `Query` results are loaded into memory and processed, it may consume substantial amounts of memory for large datasets.

###The server is essential
Because Geo Library calls multiple DynamoDB `Query` requests and processes the results in memory, it is not suitable for mobile device use. You should maintain a Java server, and use the library on the server.

###Dataset density limitation
The Geohash used in this library is roughly centimeter precision. Therefore, the library is not suitable if your dataset has much higher density.
